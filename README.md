Note: Some browsers don’t support the voice recognition (specifically, p5.SpeechRec objects), such as 
Brave and Firefox. I know that Chrome and Safari support it, however. The font also doesn’t display 
properly in some browsers (e.g. Safari).

You may have to hover over the Start Button on screen 0 to trigger the background music. Also, if saying 
a voice command doesn’t change anything after a few seconds, say the command again.

If the font appears on the start button but not on the text above it, refresh the page/run the code again 
until it does.

If the speech synthesis doesn’t work, refresh the page/run the code again until you hear a voice say the 
text on the start screen.
